    // q: what are the main principles of rest?
    // a: The main principles of REST are:
    // - Client-Server: The client and server are independent of each other. The client sends a request to the server, and the server processes the request and sends a response back to the client.
    // - Stateless: The server does not store any information about the client. Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to process the request.
    // - Cacheable: Responses from the server can be cached by the client to improve performance.   

    // q: what is the responsibility of team leader?

    // - Providing feedback and guidance to team members.
    // - Resolving conflicts within the team.
